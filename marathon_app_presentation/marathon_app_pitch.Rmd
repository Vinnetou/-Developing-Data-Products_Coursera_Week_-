# Introduction {.intro}

The app I have created is designed to help with marathon pacing. As long as runner has a time goal, app will show required pace and speed.



# {.slide}

**Fully functional app preview**

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(htmltools)
HTML('<iframe src="https://lkloucek.shinyapps.io/marathon/" style="border:none;width:100%;height:700px;"></iframe>')
```


# Why this app? {.slide}

The right pace is a crucial part of strategy to successfully finishing a marathon. No runner should skip this important step in preparation for a big run. I hope my app helps!
